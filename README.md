I am a Data analyst, lab manager and EEG technician in the CNL at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Most of the code on this page is related to my work at the [The Cogntive Neurophysiology Laboratory](https://www.cognitiveneurolab.com/) and is availible on [CognitiveNeuroLab's github page](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab).  

I work with different languages and platforms best exemplified by these repos:  
[Matlab](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/EEG_to_ERP_pipeline_stats_R)  
[R](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/Case-study-Cyclistic-a-bike-share-company)  
[Presentation (Scenario Description Language (SDL) & Presentation Control Language (PCL))](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/N-back-task-experiment) (Github calls this language scilabs)  
And I am familiar with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/douwe.horsthuis/viz/NYPD_visualizing_complaints/Dashboard1).
